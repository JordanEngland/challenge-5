# <Work Day Scheduler>

## Description

 Doing this project showed me ways on how to use jQuery and day.js. Both were very challenging to understand and how to use them properly. With time they have gotten easier and will get better the more i get to use them. JavaScript has taken me a little bit longer on writing out so far. I think the biggest struggle was how and when to use and how to write it out. Glad for all the documentation out there. So building this i learned how to color code time blocks according to past present and future. Learned how to display the current date and time on the top of the page and to continually update every second. All together a good project to get used to using day.js, jQuery, and JavaScript.
